# Facial Emotion Detection Web Application

This project is a **Facial Emotion Recognition Web App** that detects a person's emotion from an image using a **retrained deep learning model** based on the **FER-2013 dataset**.  
The model was trained in **Google Colab**, exported as `emotion_model.h5`, and integrated into a **Flask-based web application**.

## 🎯 Features
- Upload an image and detect the dominant facial emotion
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on FER-2013
- Supports **7 emotion classes**:
  - Angry
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Surprise
  - Neutral
- User-friendly web interface built with **HTML & CSS**
- Backend powered by **Flask**
- Model built with **TensorFlow / Keras**
